\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    Vector of (non-negative integer) abundances of species in a sample.
  }
  \item{size}{
    Total number of individuals in the sample. Ignored if x is supplied.

\details{

  The Fisher logseries is a limiting case of the Negative Binomial where
  the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial tends to zero. It
  was originally proposed by Fisher (1943) to relate the expected number
  of species in a sample from a biological community to the sample size as:

  S = alpha * log(1 + N/alpha)

  Where alpha is the single parameter of the logseries distribution,
  often used as a diversity index. From this relation follows that the
  expected number of species with x individuals in the sample is
  
  S(x) = alpha*X^x/x

  Where X is a function of alpha and N, that tends to one as the sample
  size N increases:

  X = N / (alpha+ N)
  
  This function implements the original numerical recipe by Fisher to
  fit the logseries distribution, given a vector of abundances, or ,
  alternatively, the number of individuals and species in the sample. Alonso et al. (2008,
  supplementary material) showed that this recipe gives the maximum
  likelihood estimate of Fisher's alpha. Hence, the function also
  calculates the log-likelihood anda Akaike information index for the fit.
