The empirical distributions of abundances (SADs)or their ranks (RADs) are modelled through probability distributions. Hence, the maximum likelihood method can be used to fit and compare competing such models. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n - Classic SAD models: logseries, lognormal, broken-stick, ... \r\n - Classic rank-abundance modelos: geometric, zipf, zipf-mandelbrodt, ...\r\n - Tools for quick diagnostic and comparison of models; \r\n - Tools to simulate Poisson and negative binomial samples from abundances in communities.\r\n\r\n### User guide\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(sads)\r\nvignette(\"sads_intro\", package=\"sads\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n - [Research project](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/let/doku.php?id=engl:projects:sads) at our [Lab wiki](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/let)\r\n - Report bugs, todos and issues [here](https://github.com/piklprado/sads/issues)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
